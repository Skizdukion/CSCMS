## Convenience Store Chain Management System for Ho Chi Minh City

### 1. Introduction/Overview

The Convenience Store Chain Management System is a web-based application designed to manage multiple convenience stores across Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The system leverages Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to provide spatial data management, location-based analytics, and operational insights for a chain of approximately 100 convenience stores.

**Problem Statement:** Managing multiple convenience stores across a large metropolitan area requires efficient spatial data management, location-based reporting, and operational oversight. Traditional management systems lack the geographic context needed for strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive management system that combines traditional store management functions with advanced GIS capabilities to optimize store operations and strategic planning.

### 2. Goals

1. **Spatial Data Management:** Enable efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of geographic data for all convenience stores
2. **Operational Management:** Provide complete CRUD operations for store information, inventory, and operational data
3. **Location-Based Analytics:** Generate statistics and reports based on geographic relationships and spatial analysis
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** Create an intuitive web interface for non-technical users to manage store operations
5. **Educational Value:** Demonstrate practical application of GIS database concepts and spatial data management

### 3. User Stories

1. **As a store manager**, I want to view all stores in my assigned district on a map so that I can plan efficient routes for store visits and supervision.

2. **As a chain administrator**, I want to add new store locations with geographic coordinates so that I can maintain accurate spatial data for the entire network.

3. **As a field supervisor**, I want to search for stores within a specific radius of a location so that I can identify coverage gaps and expansion opportunities.

4. **As a business analyst**, I want to generate statistics about store performance grouped by geographic regions so that I can identify high-performing and underperforming areas.

5. **As a system administrator**, I want to edit store information including location data so that I can maintain accurate and up-to-date store records.

### 4. Functional Requirements

#### 4.1 Store Management
1. The system must allow users to add new convenience stores with the following information:
   - Store name and unique identifier
   - Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude)
   - Physical address (street, district, ward)
   - Store size and type
   - Opening hours
   - Contact information
   - Store manager details

2. The system must allow users to search for stores using multiple criteria:
   - By store name or ID
   - By geographic location (within radius, by district)
   - By store type or size
   - By performance metrics

3. The system must allow users to edit all store information including geographic coordinates

4. The system must allow users to delete store records with appropriate confirmation

#### 4.2 Inventory Management
5. The system must allow users to add inventory items with:
   - Item name and category
   - Quantity and unit of measure
   - Store location association
   - Reorder levels

6. The system must allow users to search inventory by:
   - Item name or category
   - Store location
   - Stock levels (low stock, out of stock)

7. The system must allow users to update inventory quantities and track changes

#### 4.3 Spatial Analysis and Statistics
8. The system must provide spatial analysis capabilities:
   - Calculate distances between stores
   - Find stores within specified radius
   - Identify store coverage areas
   - Analyze store density by district

9. The system must generate location-based statistics:
   - Store count by district/ward
   - Average distance between stores
   - Coverage analysis reports
   - Performance metrics by geographic region

10. The system must display stores on an interactive map interface with:
    - Store markers with popup information
    - District boundaries
    - Search radius visualization
    - Route planning capabilities

#### 4.4 Reporting and Analytics
11. The system must generate comprehensive reports:
    - Store distribution by geographic area
    - Inventory status by location
    - Performance comparison across districts
    - Spatial coverage analysis

12. The system must export reports in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, Excel)

### 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Point-of-sale (POS) system integration
- Customer loyalty program management
- Employee payroll and HR management
- Real-time inventory tracking with barcode scanning
- Mobile application development
- Advanced supply chain management
- Financial accounting and reporting
- Customer relationship management (CRM)

### 6. Design Considerations

- **Map Interface:** Use OpenStreetMap or Google Maps integration for displaying store locations
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the web interface works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Simple menu structure with clear categorization of functions
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Use color coding and icons to distinguish different store types and statuses
- **Search Interface:** Provide both simple search and advanced filtering options
- **Data Visualization:** Use charts and graphs for statistical reports

### 7. Technical Considerations

- **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for spatial data management
- **Backend:** Django (Python) with GeoDjango for spatial functionality
- **Frontend:** React.js for interactive user interface
- **Map Integration:** Leaflet.js or Google Maps API for map visualization
- **Data Sources:** Google Maps API for initial store location data
- **Spatial Indexing:** Implement proper spatial indexing for efficient geographic queries
- **Coordinate System:** Use WGS84 (EPSG:4326) for geographic coordinates

### 8. Success Metrics

1. **Functional Completeness:** All CRUD operations work correctly with spatial data
2. **Performance:** Map interface loads within 3 seconds with 100 store locations
3. **Usability:** Users can complete basic operations (add, search, edit, delete) within 2 minutes
4. **Spatial Accuracy:** Geographic queries return accurate results within 10-meter precision
5. **Educational Value:** Demonstrates clear understanding of GIS database concepts and spatial data management

### 9. Open Questions

1. What specific performance metrics should be tracked for each store?
2. Are there any specific district or ward boundaries that need to be included?
3. What level of detail is required for inventory management (categories, suppliers, etc.)?
4. Should the system include any historical data tracking for analysis?
5. Are there any specific Vietnamese business requirements or regulations to consider?
6. What is the expected data volume and user load for the system?
